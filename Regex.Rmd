```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Loading dplyr
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
Importing measurements.csv file
```{r}
MData <- read.csv("./measurements.csv")
```


Creating new species column
```{r}
MData <- MData %>%
  mutate(Organism = sub("(\\w)\\w+", "\\1.", MData$Organism))
```


Note: Instead of doing a second dplyr command to make a new dataset including the new variable and excluding the old variable, I simply named the new variable the same name as the old variable to overwrite it

Exporting dataset to project folder
```{r}
write.csv(MData, file = "./MeasShort.csv")
```
